# OneRedOak Claude Code Workflows: Analysis & Implementation Strategy

## üìä Executive Summary

We've analyzed OneRedOak's sophisticated workflow system and identified key gaps in our current implementation. Their approach goes beyond simple automation to create a comprehensive quality assurance system with browser-based testing and specialized AI agents.

## üöÄ Optimal Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
```bash
# 1. Install Playwright MCP
npm install @anthropic/playwright-mcp

# 2. Create context directory
mkdir -p .claude/context
touch .claude/context/design-principles.md
touch .claude/context/style-guide.md

# 3. Setup agent configurations
mkdir -p .claude/agents
touch .claude/agents/design-reviewer.js
touch .claude/agents/performance-monitor.js
```

### Phase 2: Browser Automation (Week 2)
```javascript
// .claude/agents/browser-tester.js
class BrowserTester {
  async runVisualTests() {
    // Navigate to app
    await playwright.navigate('http://localhost:3000');
    
    // Capture screenshots
    await playwright.screenshot('before-interaction.png');
    
    // Test interactions
    await playwright.click('.aspect-card');
    await playwright.screenshot('after-interaction.png');
    
    // Monitor console
    const logs = await playwright.getConsoleLogs();
    
    // Check performance
    const metrics = await playwright.getPerformanceMetrics();
    
    return { screenshots, logs, metrics };
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Specialized Agents (Week 3)
```yaml
# .claude/agents/config.yaml
agents:
  design_reviewer:
    model: claude-3-sonnet
    role: "UI/UX Design Review Specialist"
    tools:
      - mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
      - mcp__playwright__browser_screenshot
      - mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages
    triggers:
      - on_file_change: "*.html, *.css"
      - on_commit: true
    
  accessibility_auditor:
    model: claude-3-sonnet
    role: "WCAG Compliance Specialist"
    tools:
      - mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
      - mcp__playwright__accessibility_check
    standards:
      - WCAG_AA_compliance
      - keyboard_navigation
      - screen_reader_compatibility
```

### Phase 4: Automated Workflows (Week 4)
```javascript
// .claude/workflows/automated-review.js
class AutomatedReview {
  constructor() {
    this.agents = {
      design: new DesignReviewAgent(),
      a11y: new AccessibilityAgent(),
      perf: new PerformanceAgent()
    };
  }
  
  async onFileChange(file) {
    // Trigger appropriate agent based on file type
    if (file.endsWith('.html') || file.endsWith('.css')) {
      const results = await this.agents.design.review(file);
      
      // Capture evidence
      const screenshots = await this.captureScreenshots();
      const console = await this.getConsoleLogs();
      
      // Generate report
      return this.generateReport(results, screenshots, console);
    }
  }
  
  async comprehensiveReview() {
    const results = {
      design: await this.agents.design.fullReview(),
      accessibility: await this.agents.a11y.audit(),
      performance: await this.agents.perf.analyze()
    };
    
    return this.generateComprehensiveReport(results);
  }
}
```

## üí° Key Insights

### What Makes OneRedOak Different:
1. **They treat Claude as an intelligent reviewer, not just a formatter**
2. **They test in real browsers, not just analyze code**
3. **They capture evidence (screenshots, logs) for every decision**
4. **They use specialized agents with defined roles and expertise**
5. **They automate subjective processes with objective criteria**

### Our Current Approach vs. Optimal:
```javascript
// Current: Basic automation
if (file.changed) {
  runShellScript('check-format.sh');
}

// Optimal: Intelligent review
if (file.changed) {
  const agent = new SpecializedReviewAgent();
  const browser = await playwright.launch();
  const evidence = await agent.captureEvidence(browser);
  const analysis = await agent.analyzeWithContext(evidence);
  const report = await agent.generateActionableReport(analysis);
  await agent.autoFixIssues(report.criticalIssues);
}
```

## üîÑ Next Steps

### 1. **Start with Browser Automation**
The biggest gap is lack of real browser testing. Implementing Playwright MCP would immediately improve our testing capabilities.

### 2. **Create Specialized Agents**
Move from shell scripts to intelligent agents that can make decisions and learn from context.

### 3. **Build Evidence-Based Reviews**
Capture screenshots, console logs, and performance metrics for every review.

### 4. **Implement Continuous Monitoring**
Set up automated workflows that run continuously, not just on manual trigger.

## üìö Resources Needed

1. **Playwright MCP Documentation**
2. **Claude Agent Development Guide**
3. **Design System Documentation**
4. **WCAG Compliance Guidelines**
5. **Performance Budget Standards**

## üéì Conclusion

OneRedOak's approach represents a paradigm shift from:
- **Manual ‚Üí Automated**
- **Reactive ‚Üí Proactive**
- **Subjective ‚Üí Objective**
- **Code-focused ‚Üí User-focused**
- **Static analysis ‚Üí Live testing**

To truly leverage their insights, we need to evolve our implementation from basic shell scripts to a comprehensive AI-powered quality assurance system with browser automation, specialized agents, and evidence-based reviews.

The path forward is clear: **Implement browser automation first, then build specialized agents, and finally create a continuous monitoring system.**
