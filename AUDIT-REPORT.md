## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

### 1. API Key Exposure (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Client-side JavaScript files contain hardcoded API keys  
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Immediate security breach risk  
**Files Affected**:
- `/src/services/HybridGenerator.js`
- `/src/services/LLMReviewGenerator.js`
- `/src/config/llm.config.js`

**Evidence**:
```javascript
// VULNERABLE CODE - API keys exposed in client
this.openaiKey = config.openaiKey || 'sk-YOUR-KEY-HERE';
this.groqKey = config.groqKey || 'gsk_YOUR-KEY-HERE';
```

**Required Action**:
1. Remove ALL API keys from client-side code immediately
2. Implement server-side proxy for all API calls
3. Use environment variables on server only
4. Rotate all exposed API keys
