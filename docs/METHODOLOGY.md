- Micro-interactions
- Touch gestures
- Smooth animations

### Phase 5: DevOps & Automation
**Duration**: Final Sprint

#### 5.1 GitHub Integration
Following industry best practices from React, VS Code, and Next.js:

```yaml
.github/

├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/   # Standardized issues
├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
├── CODEOWNERS       # Code ownership
└── dependabot.yml   # Dependency management
```

#### 5.2 Continuous Integration
```yaml
# Automated testing on every push
- HTML validation
- Browser tests
- Security checks
- Performance audits
```

#### 5.3 Documentation
- Comprehensive README
- Security policy (SECURITY.md)
- Contributing guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Code of Conduct
