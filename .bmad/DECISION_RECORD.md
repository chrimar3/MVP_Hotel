## What We Learned

Through our exploration of optimizations and enhancements, we discovered:

1. **Optimized agents** sacrifice too much quality for speed
2. **Enhanced agents** add complexity without proportional value
3. **Original agents** have the best balance of qualities

**Key Insight**: The original agents are well-designed. They don't need "fixing."

## Going Forward

### We Will:
- ✅ Use original agents as they are
- ✅ Trust their reasoning process
- ✅ Value quality over speed
- ✅ Keep things simple

### We Won't:
- ❌ Add unnecessary complexity

## The Original Agents

Located in `.bmad/agents/`:
- `analyst.md` - Business requirements analysis
- `pm.md` - Product management and prioritization  
- `architect.md` - Technical architecture design
- `developer.md` - Implementation with TDD
- `scrum-master.md` - Sprint and story management

These agents have proven their worth. They stay as they are.

## Final Word

> "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

The original agents are already at this point. They do exactly what's needed, nothing more, nothing less.

**Decision closed. Original agents remain unchanged.**
