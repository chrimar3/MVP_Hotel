# STORY-001: Quick Review Submission

## User Story
As a **hotel guest**  
I want **to submit a review in under 60 seconds with minimal effort**  
So that **I can share my experience without spending too much time**

## Priority: HIGH (Sprint 1)
## Estimated Effort: 3 Story Points

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Review form loads in less than 2 seconds on mobile devices
2. ✅ Form can be completed with 3 or fewer steps
3. ✅ No account creation or login required
4. ✅ Review text can be auto-generated based on rating selection
5. ✅ Form works on all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
6. ✅ Submission confirmation appears within 1 second
7. ✅ User can copy review to clipboard with one click
8. ✅ Form data persists if user accidentally navigates away

## Technical Implementation
### Components Required:
- `ReviewForm.js` - Main form component with step management
- `RatingSelector.js` - Star rating input component
- `ReviewGenerator.js` - Template-based review text generation
- `LocalStorageManager.js` - Form persistence layer

### Architecture:
```javascript
// State management for form
const formState = {
  currentStep: 1,
  rating: null,
  reviewText: '',
  hotelName: '',
  platform: null,
  timestamp: null
};

// Progressive form steps
const steps = [
  { id: 1, name: 'rating', required: true },
  { id: 2, name: 'details', required: false },
  { id: 3, name: 'submit', required: true }
];
```

### Key Features:
- **Auto-save**: LocalStorage saves form state every 5 seconds
- **Quick Templates**: Pre-written review templates based on rating
- **One-click submit**: Direct submission or copy-to-clipboard
- **Progress indicator**: Visual step tracker

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests:
- Form validation logic
- Template generation based on rating
- LocalStorage save/restore functionality
- Step navigation logic

### Integration Tests:
- End-to-end form submission flow
- Browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness at 320px, 375px, 768px viewports
- Form persistence across page refreshes

### Performance Tests:
- Load time < 2 seconds on 3G connection
- Time to Interactive < 3 seconds
- Form submission response < 1 second

### User Acceptance Tests:
- 10 real users complete review in < 60 seconds
- 90% completion rate for started reviews
- Zero frustration events (rage clicks, form abandonment)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Form implemented with all 3 steps
- [ ] Auto-save functionality working
- [ ] All unit tests passing (100% coverage)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design verified
- [ ] Performance metrics met
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed
- [ ] Analytics tracking implemented

## Dependencies
- None (core feature)

## Risks
- Browser compatibility issues with LocalStorage
- Mobile keyboard covering form elements
- Template reviews may seem generic

## Notes
- This is the core MVP feature - must be flawless
- Consider A/B testing different form layouts
- Templates should feel authentic and varied
- Mobile-first approach critical for 70% mobile usage target
