  "context": {},
  "next_actions": []
}

## Integration with Claude Code

### Using Task Tool
```javascript
// Invoke specific agent
Task({
  subagent_type: "business-analyst",
  description: "Analyze requirements",
  prompt: "Review PRD and create user stories"
})
```

### Context Preservation
```javascript
// Read previous agent work
const context = Read(".bmad/context/analyst-handoff.json");

// Pass to next agent
Write(".bmad/context/pm-handoff.json", results);
```

### Batch Processing
```javascript
// Run multiple agents in sequence
const agents = ["analyst", "pm", "architect"];
for (const agent of agents) {
  await Task({ subagent_type: agent, ... });
}
```

## Implementation in Your Project

Your BMAD method already follows this pattern:
- ✅ Agent definitions in .bmad/
- ✅ Context handoffs between agents
- ✅ Structured workflows
- ✅ Clear deliverables

To fully adopt agents.md:
1. Standardize agent definitions (this file)
2. Use consistent handoff format
3. Document agent interactions
4. Version control agent specs
5. Monitor agent performance

This agents.md format provides a bridge between different AI systems and ensures your BMAD methodology can work across platforms.
